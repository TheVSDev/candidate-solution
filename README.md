This is my solution to the following test: https://github.com/thomasdarde/candidate

## How to run

1. Install **Node.js** if you don't have it.
   You can check whether you have node installed by running the following command in the Terminal: `node -v`

2. Navigate to the Project Directory
   Use the terminal or command prompt to navigate to the directory where your `index.js` file is located

```sh
cd <PATH TO THE FOLDER CONTAINING INDEX FILE>
```

3. Run the script:

```sh
node index.js
```

That script will generate an HTML file in the same directory as `index.js`. After that, it suffices to double-click on it, and website will open.

## Built with

- Node.js (JavaScript): read the JSON and transform it to HTML
- CSS: style the website

## Remarks

- I didn't use Bootstrap to style the website because, personally, I prefer pure CSS because I have more control over what I want.
- In case you can't run the code, inside `example/result.html` you have the example HTML file that generates when we run the `index.js`. If you ran the script successfully and a `result.html` file has successfully been generated, then disregard the `example` directory. `example` directory (and html file within it) are there just in case if you couldn't execute the code.
